## SOUND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY FLY CYPHER REACT.JS FRONT END

/src/App.js contains the main logic for this app. It involves interacting with the back end API and filtering and sorting that information into a usable front end form. Aside from using an actual form, users interact with the visual genetic information in order to design their CRIPR gene. 

The application also allows users to download their finalized information in .ape format, a format designed exclusively for one program tha allows users to do plasmid editing: http://jorgensen.biology.utah.edu/wayned/ape/.
